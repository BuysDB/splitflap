# DIY Split-Flap Display

This project has been forked from [https://github.com/NilSkilz/splitflap] which has been forked from [https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap). Most of the design work, electronics and software was designed by ScottBez1 so he deserves a lot of thanks. 
[https://github.com/NilSkilz](NilSkilz) made the base 3d printable.

What I (BuysDB) has done far  (This fork):
- made the base NilSkilz made less solid to reduce printing time and material consumption
- created multi-material 3d printable flaps, removing the need for the PVC cards.
- Added dummy stepper motor because mine did not come in yet.

### Design Highlights ###
* 3D Printed in three simple parts
* Cheap, widely available 28byj-48 stepper motor (less expensive than NEMA-17 motors, and doesn't require an expensive high current stepper driver)
* Inject printable PVC ID cards for flaps, cheap in bulk
* Control up to 12 modules from a single Arduino

Most of the documentation has now been moved to the [Wiki](https://github.com/NilSkilz/splitflap/wiki)
