# DIY Split-Flap Display

This project has been forked from [https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap). Most of the design work, electronics and software was designed by ScottBez1 so he deserves a lot of thanks.

I've modified the project to be 3D printable (the original used laser cut MDF), and simplified the readme and wiki somewhat.

My intention is to get build a 12 module panel that is controlled over wifi via a simple iOS app and integrated with Home Assistant.

### Design Highlights ###
* 3D Printed in three simple parts
* Cheap, widely available 28byj-48 stepper motor (less expensive than NEMA-17 motors, and doesn't require an expensive high current stepper driver)
* Inject printable PVC ID cards for flaps, cheap in bulk
* Control up to 12 modules from a single Arduino

Most of the documentation has now been moved to the [Wiki](https://github.com/NilSkilz/splitflap/wiki)
